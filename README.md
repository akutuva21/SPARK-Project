# Direct vs indirect effects of radiotherapy: Opposing impact of tumor proliferation saturation on minimum dose for tumor control
This file contains a brief description of each of the code files used to simulate the various conditions required for DVR (Direct Volume Reduction) and CCR (Tumor Carrying Capacity Reduction) for radiotherapy simulations at a localized tumor region. Each of the files have been organized into various folders to aid in quick accessibility. This does not require any specific environments to run as long as the requirements below are met.
### Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
* Java 8 or higher
* Python 3.6 or higher, including the following external libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
> If you have any questions, please feel free to contact Achyudhan Kutuva at akutuva@ufl.edu.
### Running the Code
To run the code, simply execute the "run_pipeline.sh" file using a terminal of your choice. For Windows, this may be a Bash emulator (Git Bash, Cygwin) or the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). On Unix-based systems, this may be directly run within the terminal. This will compile and run the Java files, then the Python files. The output will be generated in the "Figures" folder. The "run_pipeline.sh" file can be executed by running the following command in the terminal:
``` bash
./run_pipeline.sh
```
### Figures
This folder contains the figures generated by the Python files. This folder contains sub-folders pertaining to each of the individual figures containing the corresponding figures.
### Python Files
This contains all the files needed for generating the respective figures. "Sample_Graphing.py" corresponds to Figure 1. "Death_Sweep.py" corresponds to Figure 2. "Lambda_Sweep.py" corresponds to Figure 3. Finally, "Death_PSI_Cumul_Graphs.py" corresponds to Figures 4 and 5. Within this folder, the "Testing" subfolder refers to a collection of various files primarily relegated for internal testing purposes.
### src
This folder contains a collection of various .java files that contain the data generation features. 'Dose.java' is a file containing a collection of functions related to generating *in-silico* patients with customizable dose, time, and other restrictions. 'ModelComparison.java' is the primary driver file that contains all the various settings currently available. 'Patient.java' contains the parameters for the Patient object, which contains patient-specific values along with the corresponding fractionation values.
